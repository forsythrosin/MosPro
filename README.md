MosPro
======
This is a project made by students from the Institute of Technology, Linkoping University.

The project consists of a physics engine for arbitrary convex shapes in 2D. 
There is a [project report](https://github.com/forsythrosin/MosPro/blob/master/report/Report.pdf) in swedish describing the physics and some geometrical/graphical approaches to build the engine.
