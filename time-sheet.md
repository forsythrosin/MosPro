Estimated time spent on research and implementation
===============
Times are average working time for each person each week

v.3 ~ 30 h
v.4 ~ 20 h

6hp => 4 weeks full time = 160h / person

~6 weeks to deadline => ~120h/6 = 20h/week => 2.5 full time days/week.
Simplification => 2 full time days/week + possibly weekends.

best fit: 
mondays + v.5
